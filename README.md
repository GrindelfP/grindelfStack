# grindelfStack
This is my Kotlin implementation of stack data structure

## How it works?
Stack is a generic collection of elements, which is implementing the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out): when you add several items to the stack, the only way to get the first one is to exclude all the following ones.
You can add element to the stack, exclude and return the last element, return it without excluding, know if the stack is empty, set stack container size and create a new stack, containing the elements of the initial stack, on which some operation was done.

## Creating an object of a Stack
Object of class "Stack" can be created using three different constructors:
1. With parameter "size": this way you create an instance of Stack of a particular length, which you pass as a parameter.
2. With parameter "collection": this way you create an instance of Stack and fill it completely with a Kotlin ArrayList you pass as a conctructor.
3. Without parameters: this way you create an instance of an empty Stack.

## Stack realization
### Properties (private)
1. elements: ArrayList<T?> - stack itself, realized as an instance of a Kotlin ArrayList.
2. length: Int - maximum capasity of this Stack (can be modified externally using "setSize" function).
3. upperIndex: Int - index of the topmost element of Stack (if it's equal to the size property it means, that the Stack is full).

### Constructors
1. With parameter "size": checks if size is positive integer (throws an exception if otherwise) and initializes properties of the class.
2. With parameter "collection": gets a Kotlin ArrayList of data, initializes properties of the class.
3. Without parameters: initializes properties of the class (size to 0 and stack to 0 size Kotlin ArrayList).
(NOTE: upperIndex property is always set to 0 value when initialized, exept for the case, when a collection of data is passed to the constructor - in this case upperIndex property is set equal to the size property.)

### Functions
1. push(element: T?) - adds an element of type of the Stack to the Stack.
2. pop(): T? - removes last added element from the Stack and returns it.
3. top(): T? - returns last added element of the Stack without removing it.
4. isEmpty(): Boolean - returns true if the upperIndex property is equal to 0, otherwise - returns false.
5. setSize(value: Int) - checks if provided parameter's value is less than value of upperIndex property and if so - throws an exception, otherwise sets size property to the parameter value.
6. map(mapper: (T?) -> T?) : Stack<T> - applies some function passed as a parameter to every element of a Stack and returns a new Stack of these updated elements.

### Functions (private)
1. isMonotone(collection: ArrayList<T?>): Boolean - checks if the colection passed as a parameter is monotone (if there are any null elements, they aren't surrounded by non-null elements).
2. getUpperIndex(collection: ArrayList<T?>): Int - returns the index of the last non-null element in a row.
